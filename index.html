         <div class="title">What is a token, blockchain and NFT?</div>
         <p>A token is a unit of account in a blockchain network that can be used to create digital values. A blockchain is a
         decentralized network that operates on a sequential chain of blocks that contain information about token transactions.
         Blockchain entries are not subject to change and are public, so this avoids data manipulation and ensures their security</p>
         <p>Tokens in such networks are of two types: interchangeable (fungible tokens) and non-interchangeable (non-fungible
         token). Here's a simple example: the well-known cryptocurrency bitcoin is an interchangeable token, as any bitcoin has
         the same value as another and can be exchanged with other cryptocurrencies. "Non-interchangeable" in this context means
         that it is unique, both in terms of the object it describes and its value. That is, a collector's image, which is
         represented by a token and is the only one of its kind, cannot be replaced by another similar one, because another one
         in nature no longer exist.
      In other words, NFT itself is a type of digital asset created on a blockchain, which allows you to obtain ownership of a
      product that exists exclusively on the network, such as images, animations or videos, while certifying its originality.</p>
         <div class="title">How does it work?</div>
         <p>From a technological point of view, an NFT asset is a digital certificate attached to any "digital product", such as
         images, video, audio, and so on. This certificate (token) will contain all the information about the product.
      The token is the exclusive right to the product, so owning it, buying, selling or exchanging, all these transactions are
      carried out with the product itself. We can always find out who created such a product or who now owns it, because the
      tokens are stored in an open blockchain and because of this information about the product, the history of its operations
      will be available and reliable always.So, this is an ideal opportunity to claim your rights to any unique object.</p>
         <div class="title">Digital art is the art of the new age!</div>
         <p>Let's return to the issue of digital art. It turned out to be the most appropriate and demonstrative for the masses in
         terms of the possibility of using NFT and its promotion.There are many challenges for digital artists today.
          One is that digital art objects can be easily copied and done as
         many times as you like. Yes, many will say that you can just save a picture and such saved copies can be many that do
         not differ from the original. But there is one nuance, or rather the opportunity provided by NFT - is the right to own
         the original version of the work. It is like having an original painting on display at the Louvre, and other
         reproductions and copies outside it will only promote and increase the value of this work, as it will become more
         recognizable. Therefore, NFT allows you to capture your intellectual property rights, which are confirmed in the
         blockchain.According to experts, the use of NFT can be a new tool in the field of intellectual property management, create new
         opportunities for the market and its participants, making it more convenient, because token transactions are cheap,
         simple and faster than transactions with real objects to which they tied.
         NFT tools also open up new possibilities for authors of works of art. For example, you can tokenize and sell your work
         on special sites such as OpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway. The peculiarity is that on some of them you will receive
         interest, each time your work is resold. And, as you know, if an art object becomes popular, its value increases, and
         you, as the author, will earn even more. And it does not depend on the desire or unwillingness to pay you, because the
         commission (royalty) is spelled out in a digital smart contract and will be charged to you automatically.</p>
         <div class="title">A new tool for intellectual property</div>
         <p>The huge popularity and growth forecasts of this segment of blockchain technology (which is already becoming a
         completely autonomous market) make us think about its relationship with intellectual property rights and copyright in
         particular.
         NFT tokens have proven that anything can be digitized, and this is a kind of new stage for intellectual property in the
         digital world. Intellectual property is usually unique, and patents and certificates for these objects certify the
         exclusive intellectual property right to it. Security documents (patents, certificates) contain information about the
         object itself, the intellectual property right and the time of registration and validity of this right. This is very
         similar to what the NFT token itself contains, right?</p>
         <div class="title">Prospects for NFT tokenization</div>
         <p>In themselves, the terms of smart contracts that apply to the tokenization of digital assets may be quite common in the
         intellectual property law of most jurisdictions (regarding the transfer of rights, payment of remuneration,
         authorization of certain uses and control over such use). Therefore, ensuring compliance with the requirements and
         standards for the distribution of works as copyrighted works with national law through NFT is not a critical issue. But
         it still needs a solution.
         This is especially true for defining the legal nature of the token itself as a digital asset. Given that "everything can
         be tokenized", it is sometimes problematic to define it as an intangible / digital asset, IP property rights or
         securities. Can they only be converted into currency, or used as a stand-alone entity (for investment, lending, or
         inclusion in the authorized capital of enterprises)? There are no unambiguous answers to these questions today.
         In Ukraine, tokenization of assets is not popular and sufficiently developed, as there are features of the legal
         framework. The adoption of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in the first reading of the draft law № 3637 “On Virtual
         Assets” can be considered a positive step in this direction. The draft law provides for changes in the legal relations
         arising in connection with the circulation of virtual assets in Ukraine, defines the rights and obligations of market
         participants, the principles of state policy in the field of virtual assets.</p>
